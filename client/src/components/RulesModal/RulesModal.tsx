        <h2>⚛️ Quantum Chess Rules</h2>
        
        <section>
          <h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
          <p>Capture the opponent's King to win. A King in superposition can "escape" a capture, but if captured, you win!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>♟️ Basic Moves</h3>
          <p>All standard chess rules apply. Pieces move, capture, castle, and promote as in regular chess.</p>
        </section>

          <h3>⚛️ Quantum Split Move</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Click <strong>"Split Move"</strong> to enter split mode</li>
            <li>Select a piece, then choose <strong>two</strong> destination squares</li>
            <li>The piece enters <strong>superposition</strong> - it exists at both squares simultaneously with 50% probability each</li>
            <li>Superposition pieces are shown with colored borders and probability badges</li>
            <li><strong>Kings cannot split</strong> - they must always be in a definite position</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>🎲 Quantum Capture (Measurement)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you capture a piece in superposition, <strong>quantum measurement</strong> occurs</li>
            <li>The superposition piece randomly collapses to one position based on its probabilities</li>
            <li>If it collapses to the capture square → <strong>capture succeeds</strong></li>
            <li>If it collapses elsewhere → <strong>piece escapes!</strong> Your piece still moves to the target square, but the opponent's piece survives at its other position</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>🔀 Collapsing Superposition</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Moving a piece that's in superposition <strong>collapses it</strong> to the square you move from</li>
            <li>If your superposition piece gets captured, it collapses during the capture attempt</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>⚠️ Limits</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Each player has a maximum number of pieces that can be in superposition at once</li>
            <li>This limit is set when creating the game room</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>💡 Strategy Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Split valuable pieces to make them harder to capture</li>
            <li>Attacking superposition pieces is risky - they might escape!</li>
            <li>Use splits to control more squares and create threats</li>
            <li>Remember: moving a split piece collapses it, so plan accordingly</li>
