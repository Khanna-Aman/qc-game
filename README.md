## 🎲 The Quantum Twist

| Classical Chess | Quantum Chess |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Pieces occupy one square | Pieces exist in **superposition** across multiple squares |
| Captures are certain | Captures trigger **measurement** — piece collapses based on probability |
| What you see is what you get | Reality is uncertain until observed 👀 |

---

## 🎮 Features

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Pieces can exist in superposition across multiple squares
- **Split Moves**: Knights can split into two positions simultaneously (50% probability each)
- **Measurement/Collapse**: Capturing triggers quantum measurement, collapsing superpositions
- **P2P Multiplayer**: Direct peer-to-peer connection via WebRTC (no game server)
- **Deterministic RNG**: Seeded random number generator ensures both peers see identical results
- **State Verification**: Hash-based state verification prevents desync
- **Animations**: Smooth move animations and quantum collapse effects
- **Game Persistence**: Auto-save and restore games from localStorage
- **Export/Import**: Save and load games as JSON files

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-chess.git
cd quantum-chess

# Install engine dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client && npm install && cd ..

# Install server dependencies
cd server && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..
```

### Running Locally

**Terminal 1 - Signaling Server:**
```bash
cd server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - React Client:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### How to Play

1. **Player 1**: Click "Create Room" → Share the 6-character room code
2. **Player 2**: Enter the room code → Click "Join"
3. **Play**: Click pieces to see valid moves, click destination to move

#### Move Types
- 🟢 **Green dots**: Classical moves
- 🟣 **Purple**: Quantum split targets (creates superposition)
- **% badges**: Show probability of piece being at that position

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run engine tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `client/.env` for production:
```env
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-signaling-server.com
```

## 📦 Deployment

### Client (GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages)
```bash
cd client
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder
```

### Signaling Server (Render / Fly.io)
The FastAPI server only handles WebSocket signaling for WebRTC connection setup.
Once peers connect, all game data flows directly P2P.

## 🎯 Quantum Chess Rules

### Superposition
- Pieces can exist in multiple positions simultaneously
- Each position has an associated probability (must sum to 1.0)

### Split Moves
- Knights can perform "split" moves
- The piece enters superposition at two target squares (50% each)

### Measurement (Collapse)
- Capturing a piece in superposition triggers measurement
- The piece collapses to one position based on probability
- Uses seeded RNG for deterministic results across peers

### Win Condition
- Game ends when a King's total probability reaches 0
- (King captured or collapsed out of existence)

## 🔒 Security & Fair Play

- **Move Validation**: Both peers validate all moves independently
- **Deterministic Seeds**: RNG seeds exchanged before collapse
- **State Hashing**: Each move includes state hash for verification
- **Limitations**: P2P architecture means a malicious client could cheat
